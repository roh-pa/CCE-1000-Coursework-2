This is a project based on light animations on a simulator software called Open Pixel Control.
The project is implemented in Python. A potentiometer alongside an Arduino Uno is also used to
control the brightness of the rgb lights on the software. pyFirmata has been used for python to be
able to interact with the Arduino Uno.
